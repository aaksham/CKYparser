# CKYparser

Implementation of the Generative Parser using the CYK algorithm. It is based on the techniques and suggestions in the [Klein and Manning paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/papers/unlexicalized-parsing.pdf). Files 200 to 2199 of the Penn Treebank are read in as training data. Files 2200 to 2299 are read in for validation, or 2300 to 2399 are read in for test.
